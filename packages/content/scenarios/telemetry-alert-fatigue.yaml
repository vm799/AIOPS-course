context: |
  You're the SRE lead for a SaaS platform serving 12,000 enterprise customers. Your
  monitoring infrastructure generates 847,000 metric data points per minute across:
  - 340 microservices
  - 1,200 Kubernetes pods (across 4 regions)
  - 28 databases (PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch)
  - 15 third-party API integrations

  Current alert situation (7:23 AM on Monday):
  - Slack #incidents channel: 127 unread alerts (last 45 minutes)
  - PagerDuty: 43 open incidents (severity mixed)
  - Datadog: 298 monitors in alert state
  - Grafana: 18 dashboard annotations showing anomalies

  Your on-call team is overwhelmed:
  - 3 engineers actively investigating
  - 8 duplicate alerts for same root cause
  - 15 false positives (known noisy alerts)
  - Average time to acknowledge: 12 minutes (SLA: < 2 minutes)

  Signal-to-noise ratio: Estimated 18% actionable signals

  Real issues buried in the noise:
  - API gateway p99 latency: 4.2s (normally 180ms) - CRITICAL
  - Database connection pool: 92% utilization - WARNING
  - Elasticsearch cluster health: yellow (1 node down) - MINOR

challenge: |
  Your AIOps vendor (Moogsoft) proposes implementing AI-powered alert correlation
  and noise reduction. Their analysis shows they can:
  - Reduce alerts by 73% through deduplication and correlation
  - Group related alerts into 12 incident clusters
  - Predict alert patterns to suppress known transients
  - Auto-close alerts that resolve within 90 seconds

  However, the implementation requires:
  - 2-week baseline learning period (passive mode)
  - Confidence threshold tuning (risk of suppressing real incidents)
  - Team training on new incident workflows
  - $48K annual licensing cost

  Your VP of Engineering is skeptical of "AI magic" and suggests instead:
  - Manually tuning existing alert thresholds (1 week effort, 2 engineers)
  - Implementing stricter alert routing rules
  - Requiring teams to clean up their own noisy monitors

  What is your recommendation?

choices:
  - choiceId: implement-ai-correlation
    action: Deploy Moogsoft AI-powered alert correlation
    description: |
      Proceed with AI-based noise reduction. Accept the 2-week learning period and
      $48K cost. Commit to team training and workflow changes. Trust the 73% reduction
      projection based on vendor's analysis of your telemetry patterns.
    consequence: |
      Week 1-2: Passive learning mode - alerts continue at current volume, but AI
      builds correlation models. Week 3: Activate noise reduction at 60% confidence
      threshold. Alert volume drops 68% (close to projection). Incident clusters
      reduce from 298 alerts to 19 meaningful incidents. The buried API gateway
      issue is surfaced immediately (previously hidden in noise). MTTR for real
      incidents drops from 23 minutes to 8 minutes. False positive rate: 4% (12 real
      alerts incorrectly suppressed in month 1, caught by secondary monitoring).

      6-month results: 81% alert reduction, $380K saved in engineering time (ROI: 7.9x),
      SLA acknowledgment time: 1.2 minutes (improved from 12 minutes).
    impact:
      mttr: "-65%"
      risk: low
      slaImpact: "Significant improvement - 1.2min avg acknowledgment"
      revenueImpact: "$0 - No customer impact, improved operational efficiency"
    isOptimal: true
    reasoning: |
      Alert fatigue is a well-documented operational anti-pattern that degrades
      incident response effectiveness. Manual threshold tuning doesn't address the
      fundamental problem: correlation and context analysis at scale exceed human
      capacity. The 73% reduction projection aligns with industry benchmarks for
      AI-driven alert correlation (typical: 60-80%). The $48K cost is negligible
      compared to engineering time waste (847K alerts/month × 30 seconds avg
      investigation = 7,058 hours/month wasted). The 4% false suppression rate in
      month 1 is acceptable given secondary monitoring coverage and the 2-week
      baseline learning minimizes risk.

  - choiceId: manual-threshold-tuning
    action: Reject AI - Manually tune alert thresholds
    description: |
      Assign 2 engineers for 1 week to audit all 298 monitors, adjust thresholds,
      and implement stricter routing rules. Require service teams to justify each
      alert's business criticality. No additional tooling costs.
    consequence: |
      Week 1: Engineers audit monitors, identify 47 duplicates and 23 known noisy
      alerts for deletion. Alert volume reduces 19% to 241 active monitors. However,
      the remaining alerts still lack correlation - 8 alerts for same root cause
      still fire independently. MTTR improves marginally to 19 minutes (from 23).

      Week 4: Alert volume creeps back up as new services deploy with default
      monitoring configurations. Back to 280 monitors within 1 month. The API gateway
      latency issue remains buried - detected 8 minutes slower than AI correlation
      would have surfaced it. Engineers spend 40% of on-call time investigating
      false positives. Team morale declines due to continued alert fatigue.

      Cost: $0 tooling, but 2 engineer-weeks + ongoing maintenance burden.
    impact:
      mttr: "-17%"
      risk: medium
      slaImpact: "Marginal improvement - 10min avg acknowledgment"
      revenueImpact: "$0 - But continued operational inefficiency"
    isOptimal: false
    reasoning: |
      Manual tuning addresses symptoms, not root cause. The fundamental issue is
      correlation and context analysis at 847K data points/minute - a scale problem
      that manual processes cannot solve sustainably. The 19% alert reduction is
      linear (delete obvious duplicates), not exponential (correlation-based
      deduplication). Alert volume entropy (gradual increase over time) is inevitable
      without automated governance. The approach also doesn't capture dynamic
      patterns (weekday vs weekend baselines, seasonal traffic) that AI learns
      automatically. While avoiding $48K cost seems prudent, the opportunity cost
      (wasted engineering time, slower incident response) far exceeds the savings.

  - choiceId: hybrid-approach
    action: Hybrid - Manual cleanup first, then AI for persistent noise
    description: |
      Compromise approach: Spend 1 week doing manual cleanup to remove obvious
      duplicates and tune critical thresholds, then implement AI correlation only
      for the remaining persistent noise. Delay AI deployment by 1 month.
    consequence: |
      Week 1: Manual cleanup reduces alerts 19% (same as option 2). Week 5: Deploy
      AI correlation on reduced alert set. Learning period still requires 2 weeks.
      AI achieves 61% additional reduction (vs 73% on full set). Net result: 68%
      total reduction (19% manual + 61% of remaining 81%).

      However, the 1-month delay means the API gateway issue remains buried for 4
      additional weeks, causing cumulative $47K in SLA penalties due to degraded
      customer experience. MTTR improves to 9 minutes (vs 8 with immediate AI).

      Cost: 2 engineer-weeks + $48K + $47K SLA penalties = Higher total cost than
      immediate AI deployment.
    impact:
      mttr: "-61%"
      risk: medium
      slaImpact: "Delayed improvement - SLA breach during transition"
      revenueImpact: "$47K in SLA penalties during 4-week delay"
    isOptimal: false
    reasoning: |
      Hybrid approaches sound reasonable but often introduce worst-of-both-worlds
      dynamics. The manual cleanup doesn't reduce the AI learning period (still 2
      weeks), so you've spent 3 weeks total for marginal additional benefit (68%
      vs 73%). The delay cost ($47K SLA penalties) exceeds the AI licensing cost
      ($48K), making this economically inferior to immediate deployment. The approach
      also creates change management overhead: two distinct workflow transitions
      instead of one. In operational scenarios with clear vendor validation (Moogsoft
      analyzed YOUR data, not generic projections), front-loading automation
      typically outperforms incremental adoption.

correctiveInsight: |
  This scenario demonstrates **signal-to-noise degradation** in modern observability
  and the limits of manual correlation at scale.

  Key lessons:
  1. **Alert volume is not a vanity metric** - More alerts ≠ better observability.
     Quality (actionable signals) > Quantity (raw data points)
  2. **Correlation is a computational problem, not a process problem** - At 847K
     metrics/minute, pattern detection requires machine learning, not spreadsheets
  3. **Alert fatigue is a safety hazard** - Overwhelmed on-call teams miss critical
     signals (API gateway buried in noise). This creates availability risk
  4. **Cost of inaction > cost of tooling** - $48K AI license vs $380K wasted
     engineering time is a 7.9x ROI. Operational efficiency unlocks innovation capacity
  5. **Baseline learning periods are features, not bugs** - 2 weeks of passive
     monitoring builds confidence and reduces false suppression risk

  The VP's skepticism of "AI magic" reflects a common bias: over-weighting visible
  costs (licensing) and under-weighting invisible costs (wasted time, delayed
  incident response, team burnout). Data-driven ROI analysis should override
  intuition in tool selection decisions.

contemplate: |
  Reflect on your observability strategy:
  - What is your current signal-to-noise ratio? (How many alerts are actionable?)
  - How do you measure the cost of alert fatigue? (Engineer time, MTTR, morale)
  - What threshold of confidence would you require for automated alert suppression?
  - How would you validate vendor claims before committing to AI correlation tools?
  - What cultural changes are needed to trust automation over manual investigation?
  - How do you prevent alert volume entropy (gradual increase over time)?
