title: "Module 1: Intelligent Observability as a Control Plane"
track: practitioner
description: |
  Learn how to transform traditional monitoring into an intelligent observability
  control plane that enables agentic decision-making and closed-loop remediation.
  Master the Maestro framework's six pillars, distinguish signal from noise using
  information theory, and apply causal inference to root cause analysis.

duration: 86
difficulty: intermediate

learning_objectives:
  - Explain the evolution from infrastructure monitoring to intelligent observability
  - Apply the Maestro framework (Sense → Understand → Decide → Act → Verify → Learn) to operational scenarios
  - Calculate and optimize signal-to-noise ratios in telemetry systems
  - Distinguish correlation from causation in operational data using causal graphs
  - Design telemetry pipelines that reduce noise and surface actionable insights
  - Implement human-in-the-loop validation for automated remediation decisions
