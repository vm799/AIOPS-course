track: practitioner
description: |
  Learn how to transform traditional monitoring into an intelligent observability
  control plane that enables agentic decision-making and closed-loop remediation.
learning_objectives:
  - Explain the difference between telemetry chaos and intelligent observability
  - Distinguish correlation from causation in operational data
  - Design telemetry pipelines that reduce noise and surface actionable insights
  - Implement human-in-the-loop validation for automated remediation decisions
